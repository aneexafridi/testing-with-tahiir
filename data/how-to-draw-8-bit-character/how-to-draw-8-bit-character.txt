I invite you to a lesson, in which I will show how to draw 8-BIT character. With this tutorial, you will improve your drawing skills.


In this tutorial, I want to show you how to draw 8-BIT character. Fans of computer games know that all objects have characteristic features and consist of small squares.
Now you will draw a popular character named Mario. This is a mustachioed plumber whose whole body consists of many squares. Here, Mario is depicted in motion and has the appropriate position of the arms and legs.
To successfully complete the lesson, you can use improvised materials that will help you draw perfect straight lines, but I recommend that you draw all the lines yourself and this way you will train your creativity and draw more complex objects easily in the future.
