In this lesson, you will learn how to draw a 3D building. With simple instructions, you will gain useful skills.


I am glad to offer you an interesting and useful drawing lesson in which you will learn how to draw a 3D building. Now you will once again train your spatial imagination and the ability to draw straight lines. You can use the acquired skills in the future when you want to draw a city landscape.
The figure shows an administrative five-story building. Before entering the building, there are several steps and a small canopy. Please note that the windows have different sizes and shapes, do not forget that those objects that are closer to the viewer appear larger and as they move away, the objects become smaller.
Try to correctly depict the perspective in your drawing. Memorize all the drawing steps so that you can easily draw any other building if necessary. Carefully follow my instructions and carefully draw all the lines.
