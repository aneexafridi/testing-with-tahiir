I have created for you the simple lesson on how to draw a 3D Cube. It consists of seven steps.


In this drawing lesson, you will learn how to draw a 3D cube step by step. You will be able to apply the skills you have learned in this drawing lesson to your future artwork as well.
You probably know what a cube looks like. A cube is a three-dimensional solid object bounded by six square facets or sides, with three meeting at each vertex.
Now you can prepare the necessary drawing materials and start painting step by step.

Time needed: 20 minutesHow to Draw a 3D Cube Draw one edge of the cube. You can do this step by drawing one straight vertical line. Add two more cube edges. Outline two straight lines on the right and left sides of the previously drawn line. Picture the two bottom edges of the cube. Connect the previously drawn lines to each other with two straight lines. Depict the two upper edges of the cube. Outline the angle at the top of the cube using straight lines. Add the last two edges of the 3d cube. Draw it as an angle above the previously drawn angle at the top of the cube. Erase unnecessary lines. Use an eraser to remove auxiliary lines that appeared during the drawing process. Color the drawing. You can use different shades of grey to color the 3D cube. 
Great! Now you know how to draw a 3D cube step by step. You can apply these skills when drawing a house, a box, and other objects. Were you successful in drawing this picture? You can share your feedback on this lesson in the comments, and also let your friends know about it. Especially for your convenience, I have prepared a PDF file with a short version of the lesson and now I suggest you download it. You can use this file any time you want to draw.
